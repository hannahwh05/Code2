In 2014 over half the world’s population lived in urban areas, and by 2050 it is expected to reach 66%. People have become increasingly isolated from experiencing nature due to this rapid urbanisation (Wilson, 1984; Miller, 2005). The amount of green space has quickly declined due to exploitation for development. In urban Britain, many green spaces have historical and cultural value, as well as being noted for their biological importance and role in promoting health and wellbeing. As a result, there has been increased attention paid to urban green space (Sandström, 2008).

Natural England’s ANGSt (Accessible Natural Green Space Standard) recommends that everyone, should be within 300m of green space of at least 2 hectares in size. It is based upon three principles:
<ul>
<li>improving access, </li>
<li>naturalness (including the biodiversity) and </li>
<li>connectivity (Natural England, 2010). </li>
</ul>
<br>
Urban dwellers expect good access to green spaces (Rebele, 1994). Green spaces are a fundamental part of cultural life, however, the accessible green spaces are unevenly distributed and there is a significant variation in the quality and facilities available.
